# Example repository for ramnog

This repository contains a minimum working example for the use of the ramnog suite for creating amnog-like statistical analysis.

## Using this repository
To use the ramnog suite it needs to be setup and installed. Because the package also needs some data, there is an additional step involved to download cdisc data from the cdisc pilot data.

While not completely finished, it is the intention that you can walk through different tags/releases to see how each step in the use of chef is done. For now however, you will have to do with the git history.
